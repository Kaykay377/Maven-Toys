# Maven-Toys-Analysis
 
Analysis based off Sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

## Problem statement
- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
- How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?
- Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
